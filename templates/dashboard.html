      <h2>Customer Engagement Summary</h2>
        <p style="font-size: large;">
        Based on the dashboard, customer engagement showed a slight overall decline over time. 
        This is reflected in the "Active Households by Week" chart, where the number of active households 
        gradually decreased from 2018 to 2020. Although the "Average Spend per Household" slightly increased 
        during some periods (especially around mid-2020), the drop in total active households suggests that 
        fewer customers were consistently shopping. This decline in participation, even with stable or slightly 
        higher individual spending, indicates an overall reduction in engagement.
